\arguments{
\item{gdx}{GDX file}

\item{file}{a file name the output should be written to using write.magpie}

\item{level}{spatial level of aggregation: "grid" (grid-cell) "cell" (cellular),
"reg" (regional), "glo" (global), "regglo" (regional and global) or
any other aggregation level defined in gdxAggregate}

\item{users}{NULL or "sectors" or "kcr" or "kli".
If NULL, all sectors including crop-wise water use and livestock will be obtained.
If sectors, will only report for high-level sectors - agriculture, industry, electricity, domestic, ecosystem.
Sum is applicable only in the case of sectors}

\item{sum}{determines whether output should be sector specific (FALSE) or aggregated over all sectors (TRUE)}

\item{digits}{integer. For rounding of the return values}

\item{dir}{for gridded outputs: magpie output directory which contains a mapping file (rds or spam) disaggregation}
}
