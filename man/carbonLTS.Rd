\item{file}{a file name the output should be written to using write.magpie}

\item{level}{Level of regional aggregation; "cell", "reg" (regional), "glo" (global), "regglo" (regional and global) or any secdforest aggregation level defined in superAggregate}

\item{unit}{element" or "gas"; "element": co2_c in Mt C/yr, n2o_n in Mt N/yr, ch4 in Mt CH4/yr; "gas": co2_c Mt CO2/yr, n2o_n in Mt NO2/yr, ch4 in Mt CH4/yr}

\item{cumulative}{Logical; Determines if cHWP emissions are reported annually (FALSE) or cumulative (TRUE). The starting point for cumulative emissions is y1995.}

\item{baseyear}{Baseyear used for cumulative emissions (default = 1995)}
